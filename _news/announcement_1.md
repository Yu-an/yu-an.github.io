I have been awarded a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant by the National Science Foundation to support my dissertation project investing how children learn to identify clause types and speech acts! I will present some preliminary findings at [Commit22](https://www.leibniz-zas.de/de/das-zas/veranstaltungen/details/events/commitments-in-grammar-and-discourse-commit22-1), check out my slides [here](assets/pdf/Questionhood_interrogativity_Commit22.pdf).
