I will present my work "Acquisition of belief reports by Mandarin children" with [Valentine Hacquard](http://ling.umd.edu/~hacquard/) and [Jeff Lidz](http://ling.umd.edu/~jlidz/), and "Do children know *whanything*? Acquisition of *wh*-ambiguity in Mandarin" with Dan, Valentine and Jeff at [IASCL2020](https://iascl2020.com/).
