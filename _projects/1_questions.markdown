We use language to perform various kinds of communicative acts - providing information, asking questions, making requests, etc. In any language, there are specific signals in the form of a sentence that indicates what communicative act it is typically used for. But these signals vary from language to language. In this project, we ask how children learn to identify the communicative acts of the people speaking to them while learning the surface signals associated with these acts.

Mandarin pose an additional problem: its *wh*-words (e.g. *shenme* "what") can function as question words (like English *what*) or indefinites (like English *any*, Cheng 1991 a.o.). I explore the acquisition of the indefinite meaning (joint work with <a href="{{site.data.coauthors["Daniel"].url}}" target="_blank">Daniel Goodhue</a>, <a href="{{site.data.coauthors["Valentine"].url}}" target="_blank">Valentine Hacquard</a>, and <a href="{{site.data.coauthors["Jeffrey"].url}}" target="_blank">Jeffery Lidz</a>, and find that three-year-olds are sensitive to this ambiguity.

I also use corpus data to show that the indefinite interpretation is not a Negative Polarity item (contra Lin 1996 among others) but a modal indefinite (joint work with <a href="{{site.data.coauthors["Mingming"].url}}" target="_blank">Mingming Liu</a>).
