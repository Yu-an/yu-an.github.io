In this project, I examine how children acquire speech acts like questions and clause types like interrogatives. We propose the pragmatic syntactic hypothesis: children could use syntactic, prosodic, and pragmatic features to identify questions and interrogatives, but more importantly, the learning of questions could inform the learning of interrogatives, and vice versa. We also model the learning process computationally.

IMandarin *wh*-words (e.g. *shenme* "what") can function as question words (like English *what*) or indefinites (like English *any*, Cheng 1991 a.o.). I explore the acquisition of the indefinite meaning (joint work with <a href="{{site.data.coauthors["Daniel"].url}}" target="_blank">Daniel Goodhue</a>, <a href="{{site.data.coauthors["Valentine"].url}}" target="_blank">Valentine Hacquard</a>, and <a href="{{site.data.coauthors["Jeffrey"].url}}" target="_blank">Jeffery Lidz</a>, and find that three-year-olds are sensitive to this ambiguity.

I also use corpus data to show that the indefinite interpretation is not a Negative Polarity item (contra Lin 1996 among others) but a modal indefinite (joint work with <a href="{{site.data.coauthors["Mingming"].url}}" target="_blank">Mingming Liu</a>).
