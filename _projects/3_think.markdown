Preschoolers tend to fall prey to false belief errors and reject think-sentences like (1) when the complement clause is false. However, Lewis et al (2017) show that making beliefs salient by introducing two characters (e.g., Donald vs. Minnie) with conflicting beliefs improves three-year olds' performance significantly. We that the same manipulation does not help Mandarin-speaking children with *juede* “think”.
