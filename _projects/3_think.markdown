In this project, I'm interested in Mandarin-speaking children's knowledge of attitude verbs, and how do they come to learn these attitude verbs. For the first question, I conducted behavioral studies exploring children's understanding of *juede* “think” (collaborative work with <a href="{{site.data.coauthors["Valentine"].url}}" target="_blank">Valentine Hacquard</a>, and <a href="{{site.data.coauthors["Jeffrey"].url}}" target="_blank">Jeffery Lidz</a>).

How do children learn the subcategorization property of attitude verbs (e.g. *know* selects both declaratives and interrogatives, but *think* only selects declaratives)? I examined children's input to see what kind of information is available to children (collaborative work with <a href="{{site.data.coauthors["Nick"].url}}" target="_blank">Nick Huang</a>).
