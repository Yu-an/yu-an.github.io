Preschoolers tend to fall prey to false belief errors and reject think-sentences like (1) when the complement clause is false. However, Lewis et al (2017) show that making beliefs salient by introducing two characters (e.g., Donald vs. Minnie) with conflicting beliefs improves three-year olds' performance significantly. Here we show that the same manipulation does not help Mandarin-speaking children with juede “think”.

(1) Donald thinks that Mickey is behind the chair.

Exp 1 is a Truth Value Judgment Task (TVJT) where children listen to stories of a seeker looking for a hider with a puppet, and are asked to judge the puppet’s utterance like (1). We manipulate the truth of the whole sentence (matrix truth) and the truth of the complement clause. Exp 2 uses the same material except that we introduce another seeker Minnie to emphasize the relevance of belief.  

Results show that even when beliefs are made salient in context, Mandarin-speaking children still make false belief errors. This difference between Mandarin and English children might be due to the fact juede is rarely used in the input, so children might ignore the whole matrix clause.
