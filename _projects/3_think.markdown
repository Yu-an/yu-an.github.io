In this project, I'm interested in Mandarin-speaking children's knowledge of attitude verbs, and how do they come to learn these attitude verbs. For the first question, I conducted behavioral studies exploring children's understanding of *juede* “think” (collaborative work with Valentine Hacquard and Jeffrey Lidz).

To answer the how question, I examined children's input to see what kind of information is available to children (collaborative work with Nick Huang)
