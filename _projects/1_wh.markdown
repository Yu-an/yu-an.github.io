Mandarin *wh*-words (e.g. *shenme* "what") can function as question words (like English *what*) or indefinites (like English *any*, Cheng 1991 a.o.). I explore the acquisition of the indefinite meaning (joint work with Daniel Goodhue, Valentine Hacquard, and Jeffery Lidz), and find that three-year-olds are sensitive to this ambiguity. I also use corpus data to show that the indefinite interpretation is not a Negative Polarity item (contra Lin 1996 among others) but a modal indefinite (joint work with Liu Mingming).
