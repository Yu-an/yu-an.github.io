Mandarin wh-words (e.g. shenme) can function as question words (like English what) or indefinites (like English any, Cheng 1991 a.o.). Previous studies find that children struggle with the indefinite interpretation before age four (Lin 2017, contra Zhou et al. 2014). Our study shows that 3-year-olds have both interpretations and can use prosodic (Exp 1) and syntax-semantic (Exp 2) information to arrive at the correct interpretation.

Exp 1 uses a question-statement task where children interact with an onscreen character Xiaoxiao. In the critical trial, Xiaoxiao utters Xiaoyang meifang shenme zai xiangzi li (Little Lamb didn’t put shenme in the box), either with phonological prominence on shenme, which, for adults, leads to a wh-question interpretation (What didn’t Lamb put in the box?); or without prominence, which for adults lead to a declarative interpretation (Lamb didn’t put anything in the box) yielding a yes/no response. Exp 2 uses dou-sentences like xiaoyang shenme dou zhuang xiangzili le (Little Lamb put everything in the box), which yields a yes/no response for adults regardless of phonological prominence on shenme. 

Results show that 3-year-olds are aware of both interpretations of wh-words, and can use both prosodic and syntax-semantic information to disambiguate.
