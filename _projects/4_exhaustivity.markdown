We used three experiments showing that Mandarin *shi...(de)* clefts encode exhaustivity as part of its presupposition, which is different from *zhiyou* "only" and answers to constituent questions. We also show that 6-year-olds have problem interpreting this exhaustive meaning in clefts, but not the other exhaustivity-inferring constructions (collaborative work with <a href="{{site.data.coauthors["Ying"].url}}" target="_blank">Liu Ying</a>).
