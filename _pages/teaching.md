As the main instructor:
- LING 449 Questions: meaning, use, learning (Fall 2020)
    + This seminar for senior undergraduates discussed different semantic theories of questions, the role of questions in conversations, and how children might learn to identify questions from their input
    + Due to COVID19, the class was moved online
    + Here is my [syllabus](../assets/pdf/LING449Questions-syllabus.pdf)
