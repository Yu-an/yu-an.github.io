I'm a third year graduate student in the [Linguistics Department](http://ling.umd.edu/) at the [University of Maryland, College Park](http://www.umd.edu/) where I'm also a [Language Science Fellow](https://languagescience.umd.edu/lsf). 

Broadly, I'm interested in the semantics and pragmatics of wh-words, and their acquisition. I'm advised by [Valentine Hacquard](http://ling.umd.edu/~hacquard/) and [Jeff Lidz](http://ling.umd.edu/~jlidz/). See [research](_site/menu/research.html) for more. 

When I'm not doing linguistics, I help take care of community cats with [A Cat's Life Rescue](https://www.acatsliferescue.org).  


Here's my [CV](assets/pdf/cv.pdf).

Acquisition of *wh*-ambiguity in Mandarin" with [Dan Goodhue](http://www.danielgoodhue.com/), [Valentine Hacquard](http://ling.umd.edu/~hacquard/), and [Jeff Lidz](http://ling.umd.edu/~jlidz/) at [WCCFL2020](https://wccfl2020.linguistics.ubc.ca/) and [IASCL2020](https://iascl2020.com/);
