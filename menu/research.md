Broadly, I am interested in the interaction of meaning, structure and context across different languages, in connection with language acquisition: 

-- Cross-linguistically, how does meaning interact with syntactic structure and pragmatic context? 

-- Does the interaction simplify or complicate the task of acquiring meaning? 

-- Are solutions to the acquisition of semantics that draw on pragmatics and syntax general enough to deal with the cross-linguistic differences? 

Zooming in, I want to use attitude reports and wh-words as a potential wedge into these questions: in both cases, syntax and pragmatics provide cues that would facilitate the acquisition of word meaning, but the syntactic and pragmatic cues are different across different languages. Thus, these two cases are ideal for investigating the acquisition of meaning in the context of the syntax-semantics- pragmatics interaction, with a cross-linguistic perspective.

### Semantics of Mandarin wh-words and their acquisition


With [Liu Mingming](https://mmmarkliu.wordpress.com/), I'm also developing the semantics of wh-indefinites in Mandarin. 


### Discourse particles and the pragmatics of assertions and questions





### Attitude predicates and their acquisition
Zooming in, I want to use attitude reports and wh-items as a potential wedge into these questions: in both cases, syntax and pragmatics provide cues that would facilitate the acquisition of word meaning, but the syntactic and pragmatic cues are different across different languages. Thus, these two cases are ideal for investigating the acquisition of meaning in the context of the syntax-semantics- pragmatics interaction, with a cross-linguistic perspective.

### Exhaustivity across different constructions
Exhaustive inference like “Besides John and Mary, no one else was late” could be found in sentences like *Only John and Mary were late* and *It is John and Mary who were late*. How is this inference encoded in different constructions? Collaborating with [Liu Ying]("https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/"), I explored how different constructions encode the inference.
