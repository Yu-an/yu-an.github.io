title: About My Name
---
My name is Yu'an, pronounced as [y an], tone 3 and tone 4.

If you know how to read Chinese characters, my name is written as 杨雨岸. It comes from a poem from [Song Dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_dynasty) by Liu Yong called ["Yu Lin Ling"](https://zh.wikisource.org/zh-hant/%E9%9B%A8%E9%9C%96%E9%88%B4_(%E6%9F%B3%E6%B0%B8)), literally translated as "Bells ringing in the rain". The verse with (part of) my name is the following:

杨柳岸，晓风残月.

Gloss: Aspens willow-trees river-bank, morning-breeze waning-moon

Translation: "(We) stand by a riverbank planted with willow trees
beneath the waning moon and in the morning breeze."

The poem was originally a love poem, but was re-interpreted as describing the determination of finding the truth by [Wang Guowei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Guowei) in his seminal work "Remarks on the Song Lyric and the Human Condition人间词话".
